## How to Compile?

### If you're using IDE:
* IntelliJ IDEA
* VSCode with Java extension
* Netbeans Apache
* etc...
You just need open the project stright forward and click the built-in compile 
button from your IDE.

### If you're not using any IDE:
* Open any Terminal from your Operating System.
* Open the project directory from Terminal.
* Get into `src/main/java`
  * Linux

        cd src/main/java
  * Windows

        dir src/main/java
* Compile it using (all OS):

      javac org/library/Main.java
* Linux only:

      bash ./compile.sh
* You can also use `-d` and put it somewhere on your own folder. (let's say 
you create folder `out` inside this project), 

      javac -d out/ org/library/Main.java
